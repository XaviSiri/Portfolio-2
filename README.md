# Portfolio-2
My Name is Wenceslaus Sirima Xavier.
The goal of the project is to have the NGO activiies on a digital platform since this was not availble since it's inception in 2004.
The website is now an informational hub for the NGO. This will assist in engaging supporters and increase awareness. 
In future I am looking forward to rolling the website to production.
